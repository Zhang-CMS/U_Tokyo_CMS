## ANNP-GPU-Lammps (GPU-accelerated artificial neural network potential for molecular dynamics simulation)

## Description: 
-This package is used to implement of artificial neural network potential (ANNP), which can be accelerated by using GPU card. \
-You can compile these into LAMMPS package according to the following procedures. It can support the CUDA- and OpenCL-enabled GPU card. \
-All the potential parameters (Fe) are obtained from Dr. H. Mori and co-workers (Reference 1), but the format is defined by us, as can be see the "fe_annp_potential_2.ann" file. 

-The files in the lib folder are the library, which should be complied into lammps/lib/GPU package. \
-The files in the src folder are the source files, which provide the interface to lammps. \
-If you compile the lammps package, please be careful about the GPU_ARCH, which must be consistent with your GPU cards

## Installation:
1) Download all files in "lib", "src" directors and the potential file  

2) copy all files in the "lib" directory into lammps/lib/gpu directory \
   cp ./lal_* &#8195; lammps_PATH/lib/gpu
   
   Note: \
   (a) set correct value of GPU_ARCH in "Makefile.linux" \
   (b) make -f Makefile.linux \
   (c) the "n_Block" in "lal_annp.cpp" file can be changed to make sure that the n_Block*BX/t_per_atom (mostly, BX = 256, t_per_atom = 4) large than cores on your GPU card

3) copy "pair_annp.h and pair_annp.cpp" in the "src" directory into lammps/src/MANYBODY directory \
   cp ./pair_annp.h &#8195; &#8194; lammps_PATH/src/MANYBODY \
   cp ./pair_annp.cpp &#8195; lammps_PATH/src/MANYBODY 
4) copy "pair_annp_gpu.h and pair_annp_gpu.cpp" in the "src" directory into lammps/src/GPU directory \
   cp ./pair_annp_gpu.h &#8195; &#8194; lammps_PATH/src/GPU \
   cp ./pair_annp_gpu.cpp &#8195; lammps_PATH/src/GPU \
   add the name of the two "pair_annp_gpu*" files into Install.h file in GPU directory

5) make mpi

6) If you want to use OpenCL library, it's better using the cmake to compile lammps by following procedures: \
   mkdir build_opencl \
   cd build_opencl \
   cmake ../cmake -C ../cmake/presets/basic.cmake -D PKG_GPU=on -D GPU_API=opencl -D GPU_PREC=mixed -D GPU_ARCH=sm_61 \
   make \
   sudo make install \
   Note: the definition of shared memory in cuda must be changed into local (shared__ ----> local) in the "lal_annp.cu" file  


## MD simulation in Lammps:
1) the Newton third law must be opened: \
   newton on
2) pair_style	annp \
   pair_style	* * fe_annp_potential.ann Fe


## Tested systems, GPU cards, Lammps version:
1) Ubuntu 16.04 (System)
2) Nvidia Quadro p5000 (GPU card)
3) September 2021 stable version (Lammps)
