-This package contains some implementations of artificial neural network potentials (ANNPs) by using GPU device. The flexible computation approach (FCA) is used to increase performance. You can compile these into lammps software. Please see the detailed procedures inside of each potential. 

Please contact us if you have any questions or suggestion for the implementation
